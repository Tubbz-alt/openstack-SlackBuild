# openstack-SlackBuild
SlackBuild scripts for building Openstack on Slackware. There should be a tar file for each SlackBuild script.
The packages have also been built into their respective TGZ packages and can be found here.  http://downloads.dokasystems.com/openstack-slackware/slackware-14.1/.
These are alpha level packages and still require a lot of testing.
