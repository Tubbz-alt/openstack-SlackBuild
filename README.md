# openstack-SlackBuild
SlackBuild tar files for building Openstack on Slackware.

The packages are in the process of also being built into their respective TGZ packages and once completed will be found here:  http://downloads.dokasystems.com/openstack-slackware/slackware-14.2/.

These are alpha level packages and require A LOT of testing.
