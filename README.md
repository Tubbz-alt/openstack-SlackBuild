# openstack-SlackBuild
SlackBuild scripts for building Openstack on Slackware. The tar files are for the Mitaka release. There should be a tar file for each SlackBuild script. The tar files are not guaranteed to be the latest Mitaka tars. They are merely the tar files for which the Slackbuild scripts were built.  The packages have also been built into their respective TGZ packages and can be found here.  http://download.dokasystems.com/openstack-slackware/14.1/mitaka/.  These are alpha level packages and still require a lot of testing.
