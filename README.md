# openstack-SlackBuild
SlackBuild tar files for building Openstack on Slackware.

The packages are in the process of also being built into their respective TGZ packages and once completed will be found here:  http://downloads.dokasystems.com/openstack-slackware/slackware-14.2/.

The SlackBuild tar files all being with `openstack-`.

All other tar files are the source code tar files from the Openstack website https://releases.openstack.org/ and are kept here only for convenience in building the Slackware `tgz` files.  The SlackBuild tar files will eventually be submitted to https://slackbuilds.org/ once they are completed and fully tested.

These are alpha level packages and require A LOT of testing.
